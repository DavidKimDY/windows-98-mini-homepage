# Repository Guidelines

This repository hosts a simple static website. Contributors should follow
these guidelines when making changes:

- Keep commit messages concise, in English, and under 72 characters.
- Format code with two-space indentation.
- Ensure pull request descriptions contain a **Summary** and **Testing** section.
- If `package.json` provides a `test` script, run `npm test` before committing.
- Always consult `architecture.md` and `component.md` when developing.
- If one of these files changes, verify whether the other needs updates too.
